# Next Steps

## MVP Goal: Create the "Hetzner VPS Setup" Guide

Our immediate goal is to build a minimum viable website containing a complete guide to setting up a VPS on Hetzner.

### 1. Initial Site Setup
- [ ] Configure the site title, description, and theme in `docs/.vitepress/config.mjs`.
- [ ] Create the sidebar navigation in `docs/.vitepress/config.mjs` for the Hetzner guide.
- [ ] Create placeholder Markdown files for each chapter of the Hetzner guide.

### 2. Content Creation: Hetzner Guide
- [ ] Write Chapter 1: Creating a Hetzner Cloud Account.
- [ ] Write Chapter 2: Provisioning a Server.
- [ ] Write Chapter 3: Initial Server Connection & Security.
- [ ] ... more chapters to be defined.

### 3. Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add a section on provider-specific automation tools.
- [ ] Include a guide on email server configuration.
- [ ] Explore advanced Docker topics (Swarm, Kubernetes).
