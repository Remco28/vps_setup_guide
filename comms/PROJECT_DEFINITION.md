# Project Definition: VPS Setup Guide

## 1. Project Mission & Goal

To create a comprehensive, beginner-friendly guide for setting up a Virtual Private Server (VPS) from scratch. The final output will be a web-based guide that is easy to navigate, search, and reference. This project serves as both a learning exercise and a reusable resource.

## 2. Target Audience

*   **Primary:** Individuals with some technical background (e.g., developers, students) who are new to server administration and want a step-by-step guide.
*   **Secondary:** Anyone looking for a quick reference for common VPS setup tasks.

## 3. Scope

### In Scope:

*   Initial server setup and security hardening.
*   Installing and configuring a web server (e.g., Nginx) as a reverse proxy.
*   Setting up a simple firewall.
*   Managing user accounts and permissions.
*   **Installing Docker to manage applications in containers.**
*   **Deploying containerized projects.**
*   Setting up domain names and SSL certificates (e.g., with Let's Encrypt).
*   **Basic server maintenance and monitoring.**

### Out of Scope:

*   Advanced server administration topics (e.g., complex clustering, load balancing).
*   Provider-specific automation tools.
*   In-depth database administration.
*   Email server configuration.
*   Advanced Docker topics (e.g., Swarm, Kubernetes).

## 4. Technology Stack (for the Guide itself)

**Decision:** We will use a Static Site Generator (SSG).

*   **Tool:** VitePress.
*   **Reasoning:** It allows us to write content in simple Markdown files and generates a fast, professional-looking documentation website with features like navigation and search built-in.
*   **Implementation:** We will install VitePress using `npm`, create our guide content in a `docs` directory, and configure the site structure in a `.vitepress/config.js` file. The final output is static HTML that can be hosted by Nginx.

## 5. Proposed Content Outline

1.  **Introduction**
    *   What is a VPS?
    *   Why use a VPS?
    *   Choosing a VPS Provider.
2.  **Chapter 1: Initial Server Connection**
    *   Connecting via SSH.
    *   Understanding the command line.
3.  **Chapter 2: Basic Security**
    *   Creating a non-root user with `sudo` privileges.
    *   Disabling root login.
    *   Setting up a basic firewall (e.g., UFW).
4.  **Chapter 3: Installing a Web Server**
    *   Installing Nginx.
    *   Configuring Nginx as a reverse proxy.
5.  **Chapter 4: Installing Docker**
    *   Installing the Docker Engine.
    *   Understanding basic Docker commands (`pull`, `run`, `ps`, `logs`).
6.  **Chapter 5: Deploying Projects with Docker**
    *   Example: Containerizing and deploying a simple web application.
    *   Connecting the domain to the container via the Nginx reverse proxy.
7.  **Chapter 6: Domain & SSL**
    *   Pointing a domain name to the server.
    *   Installing Certbot and getting a free SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt.
    *   Configuring Nginx for SSL.
8.  **Chapter 7: Basic Server Maintenance**
    *   Updating system packages.
    *   Monitoring system resources (CPU, RAM, disk).
    *   Log management strategies.

## 6. Architectural Decisions

*This section records the initial architectural decisions for the guide's content.*

1.  **Deployment Examples:** The guide will provide Docker deployment examples for two common project types:
    *   A simple **static HTML website**.
    *   A basic **Node.js (Express)** application.
2.  **Maintenance Focus:** The maintenance chapter will prioritize and provide instructions for:
    *   Setting up **automated security patches** for the system.
    *   Implementing a simple, free service for **downtime monitoring**.
3.  **Service Scope:** The guide will focus exclusively on hosting web applications. It will not cover hosting other services like databases or code repositories to maintain a clear scope.
